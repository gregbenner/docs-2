## Overview

A generator can be specified via the `generator` block in the Prisma schema. Generators in your Prisma schema specify what assets are generated when the `prisma generate` command is invoked.

## Binary targets

Prisma relies on several [engine binaries](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines). For example, Prisma Client uses the [query engine binary file](../prisma-client/query-engine) under the hood to communicate with a database. Prisma Migrate uses the migration engine binary file to run schema migrations against a database.

These _engines_ are implemented in Rust and are used by Prisma in the form of executable _binary files_.

Being aware of the binary file is especially important when [deploying](../prisma-client/deployment) your application to production!

> **Note**: You can learn more about binary targets in the [spec](https://github.com/prisma/specs/blob/master/binaries/Readme.md).
